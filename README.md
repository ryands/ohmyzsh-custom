# ohmyzsh-custom

My zsh themes, scripts, and plugins.

## Installation

### Typical

1. Install oh-my-zsh to `~/.oh-my-zsh/`
1. `rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/*` (custom/ is prepopulated with examples but is `.gitignored` so you can stick a custom repo there)
1. restart your zsh session.

### Using my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ryands/dotfiles)

Why are you using my dotfiles? You should learn from them, but my complete setup probably isn't for you.  If you insist, 
my `dotfiles install` script will do it all for you.
